# Vibration-characteristics-of-SDOF
Evaluate the vibration characteristics (undamped and damped natural frequencies, critical damping, damping ratio) of a single degree of freedom spring-mass-dashpot system 
 m = 1kg, c = 2.5 N-s/m, k = 60 N/m. Initial conditions at t = 0 are xo = 1.0 cm and vo = 5.0 cm/s. 
 displacement vs. time equation and plot the displacement response for n cycles for this system
